## Overview

OpenStage is a tool for bank's customers where they can gather together to discuss financial news, new products, investing strategies and much, much more! 

## Motivation

### Socialising
It's not a secret that pandemic has changed the world. Interactions are very limited nowadays, so we're trying to find new ways of staying together despite the safety measures. Successful stories of application like [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/) proves us, that in most of the cases messaging application are not enough. We still prefer to talk to, listen to and see other people. Bank community is a perfect place to start such initiative. Predefined channels help to find interesting topics.

### Marketing
It's not a secret that pandemic has changed the world. Interactions are very limited nowadays, so we're trying to find new ways of doing old things in new reality. In places like Facebook Groups we can notice how sellers changed the way they approach customers. It's more and more common to organize live sessions to show products to potential customers. We came with an idea to create a live streaming app dedicated to selling products. During live session in a channel of your choice a "seller" can define an offer for potential customers, provide live demo and answer all the questions.
